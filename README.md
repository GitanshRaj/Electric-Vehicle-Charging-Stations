# Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Stations
**Project Title:** Exploratory Data Analysis on Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook

**Description:**
Conducted exploratory data analysis on a dataset of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations to
uncover key insights into station availability, location distribution, charging types, and usage
patterns. Cleaned and preprocessed raw data using Pandas and NumPy. Visualized
geographical spread and usage trends with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Identified areas
with low charging infrastructure density and peak usage hours to support infrastructure
planning and policy recommendations.

**Key Contributions:**
- Analyzed geographic distribution and clustering of EV stations using location data.
- Assessed charging type popularity (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast Charging).
- Created interactive visualizations to highlight high-demand areas and usage times.
- Provided actionable insights to optimize station placement and utilization.
