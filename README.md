# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Charging Stations – Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Title:
**Exploratory Data Analysis on Electric Vehicle Charging Stations**

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📖 Project Description:
This project explores a dataset of **Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations** to uncover patterns in station availability, location distribution, charging types, and user behavior. Using a combination of Python libraries, we cleaned the dataset, transformed it for analysis, and developed visualizations to support decision-making in EV infrastructure planning.

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Understand the geographic distribution of EV charging stations.
- Analyze the popularity of charging types (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast Charging).
- Identify high-demand locations and peak usage times.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve coverage and efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Contributions:
- 📍 **Geographic Mapping**: Analyzed location coordinates to understand clustering and underserved areas.
- ⚡ **Charging Type Analysis**: Assessed the adoption and frequency of Level 1, Level 2, and DC Fast Chargers.
- 📊 **Visual Exploration**: Created static and interactive visualizations to examine temporal and regional trends.
- 🧠 **Insights & Recommendations**: Highlighted potential areas for expansion and optimized station placement.

## 📈 Sample Visuals:
- Heatmaps of station density by state/city
- Bar charts of charger type frequency
- Time-series analysis of usage patterns
- Interactive geographical map (Plotly)

## ✅ Outcome:
The analysis helped identify key regions with limited EV infrastructure and recommended optimal charging station types and times for operation. These findings can guide EV policy, investment, and infrastructure expansion strategies.
